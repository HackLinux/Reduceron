Below are instructions for getting and building a version of Yhc that
is compatible with the Reduceron.  This version of Yhc only builds
with GHC version 6.6.  To install GHC 6.6 for Linux:

  # In any directory of your choice
  wget http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/6.6/ghc-6.6-i386-unknown-linux.tar.bz2
  tar xzf ghc-6.6-i386-unknown-linux.tar.bz2
  cd ghc-6.6
  ./configure
  make in-place
  export PATH=`pwd`/bin/i386-unknown-linux:$PATH

Now to build Yhc.

  # In any directory of your choice
  wget http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/mfn/yhc-reduceron2.tar.gz
  tar xzf yhc-reduceron2.tar.gz
  cd yhc-reduceron2
  scons
  export YHC_ROOT=`pwd`
  export YHC_BASE_PATH=$YHC_ROOT/inst/
  export PATH=$YHC_BASE_PATH/bin:$PATH

Now you just need to type "make.sh" in the reduceron2/source directory
to build the executable "reduceron".

You can compile examples, e.g. Fib.hs

  yhc -linkcore Fib.hs

and turn the resulting Fib.yca into a VHDL netlist:

  reduceron Fib.yca -o Fib

The file "Fib.vhd" will now be produced.  This will synthesise with
XST for a suitable FPGA device.  If you want a high clock rate,
remember to turn on "Optimise instantiated primitives" in the XST
synthesis options.

Note that the Reduceron is quite limited in the number of primitive
Haskell functions it supports.  Look at the examples to see what
works! :-)
